# Prayer Time
A bash script that lives on the terminal that tells you when the next prayer is, works great when hooking it up to a keybind on a wm like hyprland

# How to config for your own location
It's very simple, look up your country (or area's) latitude and longtitude, and input them into lines 3 and 4 after the = sign

# WARNING
In the 5th line where it says method, make sure to double check if the method there is right one for you:
- METHOD=1: University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi
- METHOD=2: Islamic Society of North America
- METHOD=3: Muslim World League
- METHOD=4: Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah (default setting)
- METHOD=5: Egyptian General Authority of Survey

**Note**: This is the _method_ of calculating the time, there is usually a difference in scholorly opinion, but in general there shouldn't be an extremely big time difference between these, usually just a couple of minuites, additionally some methods are adjusting for extreme latitudes where the rules can differ because of these latitudes e.g In summer for some areas in these extreme latitudes, Isha prayer might not occur because the sun does not get low enough
